I am currently an undergraduate student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Pusan National University.
I am interested in AI fields such as Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Generative Models.

## The purpose of this blog

I am writing this blog to record my study and research.
This blog will contain my thoughts, study notes, and research results.
It will be grateful if this blog helps someone who is studying the same field as me.

I also hope that writing will help me improve my English writing skills.
